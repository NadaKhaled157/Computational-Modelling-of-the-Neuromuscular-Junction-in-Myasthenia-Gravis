# Computational-Modelling-of-the-Neuromuscular-Junction-in-Myasthenia-Gravis
## Introduction
<p align="justify"> This research presents a mathematical model that investigates acetylcholine dynamics in the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in the context of Myasthenia Gravis (MG), a neuromuscular disorder that leads to weakness of skeletal muscles. 
The model utilizes numerical simulations to study the dynamics of acetylcholine release. The MATLAB simulation results align with the physiological explanation, making this model a valuable tool for studying NMJ dynamics. </p>
